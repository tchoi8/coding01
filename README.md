# coding 01

Coding 01 is a collection of resources to help someone with very little experience of working creatively with technology. It's designed to build foundation for the beginner to understand the basic concepts and become familiar terminologies. It's goal is to help them  to gain technical literacy and become confident to explore more intermediate materials and advanced topics in the future. 

Since there are great amount of resource for the visual learners, artists and designers to learn to program through platforms like Processing and openFrameworks, this resource will focus on bibliophilias, writers, poets, journalists and researchers as the target audience. Thus, we will bring in literary examples, exoloratory writing exercises as well as critical theory that relates to coding.
